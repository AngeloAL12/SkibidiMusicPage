# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **SkibidiMusic Bot** ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Discord bot. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## 2. Information Processed

To function, the Bot temporarily processes the following data:

*   **Discord User ID:** To know who requested a song.
*   **Discord Server (Guild) ID:** To manage the music queue for your specific server.
*   **Voice Channel ID:** To join the correct voice channel.

**Important:** This data is **NOT stored** in any database or file. It exists only in the Bot's memory while it is running and is lost when the Bot restarts.

We do **NOT** collect or store:
*   Personal messages (DMs).
*   Voice conversations.
*   Personal identifiable information (PII).

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information solely for the purpose of:
*   Providing the music playback service.
*   Managing queues and playlists.
*   Enforcing our Terms of Service.
*   Troubleshooting technical issues.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others.

We may interact with third-party services (YouTube, Spotify, Deezer) to retrieve music content. These services may collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies when content is requested.

## 5. Data Retention

Data such as the current music queue is stored temporarily in memory and is cleared when the Bot restarts or when the queue is cleared. We do not maintain a persistent database of user activity history.

## 6. Your Rights

You may request the deletion of any data we may have stored about you (if any) by contacting us. However, since we primarily store transient data necessary for the Bot's immediate function, simply stopping use of the Bot will effectively cease data collection.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## 8. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AngeloAL12/SkibidiMusic).
